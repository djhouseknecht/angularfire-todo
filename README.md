## Database
This was my first time using AngularFire or a NoSQL database. It was fun and quick to get started. I didn't get the auth rules working the way I wanted to. I need to dive into the docs a little deeper to understand how to structure and query data tied to a single user. 

## First Time Using AngularFire

I know some of the UI is not the best. I would have liked a cleaner login page and smooth transitions between pages and actions. I learn angular fire and wrote this in a week. It isn't my best work. Maybe in the future I will have some time to revisit this and iron out some of the details.
